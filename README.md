# BRACU-Lost-and-Found
This is our CSE471 project for Summer 2025 semester

This project is created keeping in mind that every lost item has their owners. So whenever a person loses/finds an item in the campus vicinity, the first thing they will do is go to the info desk and file a lost item report. This site will help students as well as faculties to post about lost/found items.
